# Waterford City Route Finder

### Group Project: Semester 2, Year 2.
> Completed Solo 


This project allows the user to select two points by clicking on a map of Waterford City, and find the best route from source to destination using one of a number of shortest-path algorithms (including ***Dijkstra's Algorithm, Breadth-First Search and Depth-First Search***). 

The JavaFX GUI uses the nodes and vertices in the ***custom graph-based data structure*** to identify and mark the chosen route on the map as blue pixels.

An assortment of J-Unit tests are included ensuring method's integrity despite code refactoring.
